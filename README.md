This the root directory for all the Videos' Assigment

The video tutorials here are anchored by DANI KROSSING

All the videos are all about how to use HTML and CSS to design a website or web apps

This directory contains what I have learnt from video 1 - 20

This directory is also broken into weeks folders (e.g week 1 )

Each week contains the number of videos instructed to watch for such week (e.g Week 1 contain video 1 - 7)

Note that, a file is created on VScode per video to showcase what I have learnt.
